				<h3>More About <span>The Ethical Slut: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships &amp; Other Adventures</span></h3>
				<p>The problem is that when you blame someone else for how you feel, you disempower yourself from finding solutions. Dossie Easton, The Ethical Slut : A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships &amp; Other Adventures // Only actions can be crimes. Let us repeat that one: emotions are never wrong; only actions can be wrong. Emotions are an expression of our emotional truth, and truth cannot be wrong. Nor do they need to be justified. They just need to be felt. Remember, Dossie Easton, The Ethical Slut : A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships &amp; Other Adventures // So whats wrong with wanting attention? Isnt there plenty? Remember about starvation economies: Dont shortchange yourself. You do not have to be content with little dribs and drabs of comfort, attention, support, reassurance, and love. You get to have all the comfort and reassurance you want. Dossie Easton, The Ethical Slut : A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships &amp; Other Adventures //</p>
				<p>Let me preface this by saying that I am non-monogamous and do not have a problem with the relationship structure the authors are advocating. But I do not like being talked down to, and I do not like assumptions that people who need or want monogamy are unevolved or unloving or unfair. There is plenty of all of that in this book. I read... This book should&#39;ve been called &#34;How To Be a Human Being.&#34; :) Everything it talks about has to do with how to have effective and enriching relationships in all their forms. Own your feelings, be honest, be open about what you want, be willing to compromise, talk to each other, listen to each other... I was particularly interested in... Firstly: make no mistake, this is a self-help book. Be wary if you are someone who dislikes endless cheerleading on why you should respect and love yourself! and others! and the birdies and the treeeeees! -- okay, I&#39;m exaggerating, but people who find self-help jargon grating should proceed with caution. There&#39;s a LOT of &#34;learning to...</p>
