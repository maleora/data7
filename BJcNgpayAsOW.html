				<p class="excerpt">
					 A Literature, Fiction book. He was neither good looking nor ugly, and while he would not have turned a young girl&#39;s head, someone older...
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					The Peruvian guerilla leader Ezequiel is responsible for tens of thousands of fiendishly cruel murders, yet he consistently eludes capture. But in Agustn Rejas he has an indefatigable pursuer. From secluded city streets to the paths of a mountain village the policeman persists, tracking and anticipating Ezequiel&#39;s every move. Rejas&#39; only reprieve is his love for his daughter&#39;s beautiful dance teacher--until he begins to pick up unmistakable signals that her circles--and Ezequiel&#39;s--intersect.Based on the extraordinary manhunt for the leader of Peru&#39;s notorious guerilla organization, The Shining Path, The Dancer Upstairs is a story reminiscent of Graham Greene and John LeCarr--tense, intricate, and heartbreaking.

				<h3>More About <span>The Dancer Upstairs</span></h3>
				<p>Tell me. You&#39;re a man who understands history,&#34; I said. &#34;If you want to start a revolution, why not issue a manifesto? Why not show the people who you are, what you&#39;re doing?&#34;He leaned back, grateful to explain. &#34;That&#39;s perfectly understandable. Socrates wrote nothing down. Neither did Jesus. The problem with text is that it assumes it&#39;s own reality. It cannot answer, and it cannot explain. Nicholas Shakespeare, The Dancer Upstairs // He was neither good looking nor ugly, and while he would not have turned a young girl&#39;s head, someone older might have been struck by his face and the evidence of passion which had left its traces. ~p17 Nicholas Shakespeare, The Dancer Upstairs //</p>
				<p>Underwhelming. I love the movie, seen it many times. I discover a lot of books that way, by loving a movie. Unlike most book lovers, I don&#39;t buy into the myth that the book is &#34;always&#34; better. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn&#39;t. In this case, the movie was better.What a story! Now that I know the author was inspired by a true story,... I read a lot of &#34;movie books&#34;, meaning both about movies and books that have been turned into them. I think it&#39;s fun. Most of the books that have been turned into movies are good or just better than the movie. This was definitely the case with the book &#34;Sphere&#34;. What a horrible excuse for a movie. But this book is good. But for some... A riveting story told by Colonel Augustin Rejas to a foreign correspondent, John Dyer, of his investigation and capture of a Peruvian guerrilla leader.Dyer was pursuing a different man for an interview when by chance, he met Colonel Rejas. Just like Dyer, I was completely sucked in by the story Rejas was relating. It&#39;s not just about...</p>
