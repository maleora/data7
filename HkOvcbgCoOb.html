					 Angel Rock Leap is inspirational and powerful. Nineteen year old Sarah...
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					In Angel Rock Leap, Sarah discovers there is a fine line between love and repulsion, friends and enemies, and sanity and lunacy. Can a person&#39;s life really be over at just nineteen? Sarah challenges this notion when her chosen career crashes and burns, leading her to realize that she has to stop being a willing victim both professionally as well as personally in order to find her road to success. Passivity ends and rebellion begins once Sarah decides to return to her hometown to face down failed relationships and gain a better understanding of the things that might be holding her back in life. She uses her newfound knowledge about herself to pull others out of similar crises, as love is rediscovered and friendship is borne out of adversity.From the Back CoverAngel Rock Leap is a twisty journey through the jagged terrain of intimidation, love and choice. I couldn&#39;t put it down! -Gina Rosati, author of AuracleA lonely college dropout, an aimless philosophically driven young man, a female school bully who never grew up, and a few other troubled characters lost in the space of rural...

				<h3>More About <span>Angel Rock Leap</span></h3>
				<p></p>
				<p>My 16 year old read it. She really enjoyed the flash backs, how the characters all connected together.She didn&#39;t like the character Sarah ended up with, but that made it a neat surprise.The message was appropriate for this age group and she really recommends it to other teens and young adults. Angel Rock Leap is inspirational and powerful. Nineteen year old Sarah returns to her hometown and confronts issues and people from her past, including the memory of having been bullied in high school. The characters are believable and the story is relevant to young people today. Ellen Weisberg is a talented writer and readers will... I had read Ellen Weisberg&#39;s book earlier, but now I read it again, just to determine if I had missed anything. The subtle bullying which became evident as the story unfolded told it all.
