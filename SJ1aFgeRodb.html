				<p>Then his lids closed slowly over his slightly bloodshot eyes, and Mort Rainey, who had yet to discover what true horror was all about, fell asleep. Stephen King, Four Past Midnight // And didn&#39;t they say that, although curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought the beast back? Stephen King, Four Past Midnight // A woman who would steal your love when your love was really all you had to give was not much of a woman. Stephen King, Four Past Midnight //</p>
				<p>Actual rating; 3.5 starsA collection of four short stories:The LangoliersSecret Window, Secret GardenThe Library PolicemanThe Sun DogThis collection doesn&#39;t quite stack up to the King quartet; Different Seasons, but it is still classic Stephen King. The first two stories were on the boring side, mostly because I had seen the movies. The third story, The Library Policeman, was actually pretty good up until one moment that involves trigger warnings (view spoiler)[A young boy is raped and what it feels like is described... I was going to say too much but any description was too much.... This is yet another re-read for me, and oh, I&#39;d say it&#39;s been at least 8 or 9 years since I&#39;ve read it, but I remember liking it a lot back then, my friend had a copy and I didn&#39;t, I had dark thoughts of booknapping and possible ransom. Happily, I have my own copy nowadays to read whenever I please. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s taken me so...</p>
